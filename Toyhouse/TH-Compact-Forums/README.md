# ToyHouse Compact Forums
---
## Script Description
**A userstyle made with stylus.**

Makes the forum pages more compact. Is configurable meaning you can click on th gear icon in stylus and edit how much padding you want and how big you want the icons.

## Creator's Notes
I made this because personally even with a 1920x1080 display I felt that the forums used up a lot of space. Even more so on a 1366x768 display.

<!-- My goal for this script is to have a dial that lets the user choose how much padding and how big stuff can be.-->
