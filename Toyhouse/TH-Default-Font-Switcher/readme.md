**This switches the default font on toyhou.se!**

**Theres 2 options.**

1. A dropdown with toyhou.se safe fonts.
2. A text input where you can type whatever font your computer has. (You need to select "Custom" on the dropdown first.)

~~Here are some screenshots below (open in new tab for full resolution/size):~~

### EDIT: Ok so from my end it looks like the images are broken ok idk why. So just open the image files above until I fix it. >:(
