<p><b>Until then please disable this userstyle whenever you're using the site's built-in code editor!</b></p>

<h2>This switches the default font on toyhou.se!</h2>

<b>Theres 2 options.</b>

1. A dropdown with toyhou.se safe fonts.
2. A text input where you can type whatever font your computer has. (You need to select "Custom" on the dropdown first.)
